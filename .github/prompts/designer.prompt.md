Your goal is to generate a draw.io document

Ask for the name of the diagram if not provided and name the file using kabab case.

When generating a diagram, ensure that:
- You have a blue block to represent the domain layer.
- You have a green block to represent the application layer.
- You have a yellow block to represent the infrastructure layer.
- You have a red block to represent the presentation layer.

Save the diagram in the `diagrams` folder under the docs folder.
If the `diagrams` folder does not exist, create it.
